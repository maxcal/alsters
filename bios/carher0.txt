When I finished my economy studies at Karlstads University i chose to persue my two greatest interests; DJ:ing and web development.
 I drove the web-service vemringde.se for four years and build web pages for customers all over europe.
To Elvenite i brought a burning passion for creating user-friendly applications for the web. Elvenite is not just a job, I love discussing challenges and solutions with our customers and then seeing how these measures improve the daily lives of both the company at large and the individual user.
