Currently I'm the Chief Financial Officer at Elvenite where I have been since 2010. I aquired a Masters in Business Administration at Karlstad University in 2009 before joining up with Elvenite.
The best part about working with Elvenite is all the great collegues and beeing in the loop both with the company and my own situation.
I'm originally from Skellefte√• but now live in Kristinehamn with my boyfriend and daughter. Currently, I spend most my time renovating the house or taking care of my family but I enjoy yoga and traveling when the opportunity arises.
