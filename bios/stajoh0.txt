I´e been a Application Consultant at Elvenite since march 2011, I work exclusively with Business Intelligence with QlikView as my main tool. Developing and learning every day is driving force for me and QlikView makes this possible.
Before Elvenite, I was employed in manufacturing with mixed tasks with supply chain, production and IT. I´m a have a degree in systems sciences from Karlstad University. I spend most of my free time with two children, sporting or working out.
