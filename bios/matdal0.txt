I have worked at Elvenite since 2008 as a senior business consultant, primarily within the area of Business Intelligence. Previously I was a support consultant at Intentia and a systems developer at Forest & Timber AB. I studied aeronautical engineering at MÃ¤lardalen University but got into IT through my thesis and and interest in technology. The goal of my work is to find solutions that give our clients a better daily life and make it possible for them to work with constant improvements.
I spend my time off golfing and running, and I like to ski during the winter.
