I have been at Elvenite since 2009 och have the privilege of working from my home office in TÃ¶cksfors close to the norwegian border as a Movex/M3 consultant. I previously worked at Intentia and Syteam and have been in the IT industry since 1999. Before becoming a consultant I had several leadership postitions within the engineering industry concentrated around logistics, production and IT.
I spend my free time with my family and try to get as much exercise as possible.
