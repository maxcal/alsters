I was among the Elvenite founders back in 2007. I always strive to help and make the custom happy and satisfied. I always see the possibilities and what drives me in my work at Elvenite.
 I have a background in technology and working as a Movex/M3 software consultant.
 Currently I'm the operations manager and make myself available to our customers together with our clients, I also keep daily contact with our customers and suppliers.
  In my free time I recharge my batteries by exercising, enjoying the outdoors or just relaxing. I like to challenge myself, and will happily jump into a venture where the outcome is known.
