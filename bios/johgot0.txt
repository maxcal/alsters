I started my carrier as as press photographer but fortune brought me to study at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. After graduating in 1987 I made a name for myself in the steel business.
I have alsway been drawn to operative roles, among other things as the head of a steel mill, the chief of logistics and later senior project manager at Intentia and Lawson.
I am currently Elevites executive director and have a passion for developing both Elvenite and our clients in the best possible way together with our amazing team.
I like to fill my leisure time with physical activities such as running, skiing and diving. Preferably with my wonderful family. I enjoy learning new things and, field very comfortable outdoors search for birds through a pair of binoculars.
