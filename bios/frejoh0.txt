In 2012 I became the Sales Manager at Elvenite. My main focus is the ensure that we are driving our customers and their operations forward to that they remain competitive on the market. I have over 20 years of sales experience in several branches. I started my carrier in the Unilever Concern and continued on at TeleOffice/TDC. In addition I spent a few years at Stadium Promotion and Consafe Logistics before i joined up with Elvenite.
I have had a leadership position within sales or responsibility for a sales territory at all of these companies.
I spend my free time sporting; mostly in form of tennis, golf, floorball and skiing.
