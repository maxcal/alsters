I have been at Elvenite since the fall of 2012, I'm a project-leader for both internal development as well as external projects.
I have a degree in economics from Karlstad Business School and have since then worked as a project lead at the Swedish-American Chambers of Commerce both in Washington DC and Stockholm.
When I returned to Karlstad i sought out new challenges saw the potential for personal and professional development at Elvenite.
Most of my free time is spent exercising; preferably running or football. When I travel it's back to the USA or trips into the woods of VÃ¤rmland.
