I have been a Business Consultant at Elvenite since January 2013.
Prior to this I was at Etac, which uses Movex/M3, where I worked with internal M3-projects and support. I have also gathered a rich knowledge of M3 from my previous position as Business Consultant at Infor. I have an easy time grasping processes and businesses.
I choose Elventite primarily for the warm workplace environment, the values and corporate culture.
Outside work I like to run and do other activities which fill my life with energy. IÂ´ very committed to streamlining and being able to help improve the everyday life of others.
