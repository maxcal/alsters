I was hired at the beginning of 2013 as a Business Consultant and work primarily with ERP and Integration. I got my Civil Engineering degree from the University of Link√∂ping 2012, where I specialised in marketing and logistics. During my studies I have had time to spend a year in San Diego, USA and my masters thesis at AGA:s marketing department in Stockholm.
I travel as much as possible to see and experience new things. If I have any time left over from traveling I like to ski and do cardiovascular training in any form.
